Hi,

This scene was built as a template for you to be reused in anyway you want.

However, apart for the file island.wrl which is totally free of copyright, 
the code was built using libraries of objects from trialware tools :

Cosmo Home Space Designer (CosmoSoftware)
VRCreator (Platinium)
Community Place Conductor (Sony)
Internet 3D Space Builder (Paragraph)

Refer to those products for more information about your legal rights.

Moreover, the flying seagull is taken from the VRML98 Conference that held in
Monterey, and was originally designed by Cindy Reed-Ballreich.
